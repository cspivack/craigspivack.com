Working with Nuxt 3 for a project at my job motivated me to update my personal site from Nuxt 2, and that is now all set. There's a lot to learn with finally being forced into Vue's Composition API, but overall it does feel less bloated, and Vite is a noticeable upgrade.

Since it was essentially a page one rewrite, I've decided to finally get a blog going here as well. My friends and I have talked for years about how blogging and forums need a comeback, and with Twitter being driven off a cliff I have less of an excuse than ever.

For the web to truly be open, people need to be able to move away from platforms and not have their "content" be monetized. Not everyone is a nerd like me and builds their own site, so it's on us as tech workers to put more power in the hands of users; not just the power to do things, but the power to control their own little space on the web.

What to expect from me here? Probably the occasional post about something I've learned or what I think about the state of the internet (hint: it's not good). Right now the site is a little visually boring, so I might add some \<blink\> tags in.
